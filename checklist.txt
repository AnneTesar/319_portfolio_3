Tried to deploy to cs319.cs.iastate.edu/home/atesar/Portfolio3/index.html but having a hard time actually navigating there. 
This should run just fine locally for you though; it's pretty simple. 

The functionality and code that's important is pretty much all of it. But it's displayed in a way that it should be very easy
to understand. More complicated examples are in the "More Animation with SMIL" section. All examples have their code snippets
directly next to their demo on the page.
